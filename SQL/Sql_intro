WHAT IS SQL?

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage and 
interact with databases. Databases store large amounts of information, and SQL helps us organize 
that data into tables, retrieve it when needed, modify it, and remove unnecessary records. It is 
the standard language used in almost all relational databases, making it extremely important in the 
world of data and software development.

WHY WE USE SQL ?

We use SQL because it provides a simple and powerful way to manage data. When businesses handle 
thousands or millions of records—such as customer details, employee information, product lists, or 
transactions—SQL helps them handle all this easily. It allows us to search for specific data, 
update information, insert new records, and delete old ones. With just a few lines of SQL, we can 
perform tasks that would otherwise be very complicated. This makes SQL essential for building 
reliable, efficient, and secure systems.

WHERE WE USE SQL ?

SQL is used across almost every industry and technology platform. Websites like Amazon, Instagram, 
and YouTube use SQL databases to store user profiles, posts, orders, and activity. Mobile apps such 
as Swiggy and Ola depend on SQL to manage ride details, order history, and user accounts. In 
backend development, languages like Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, and .NET all connect to SQL 
databases to store and retrieve data. Beyond tech companies, SQL is also used in banking, finance, 
data analytics, and business intelligence. Wherever large amounts of data need to be managed 
quickly and safely, SQL is the key tool.

SQL COMMANDS 

DDL 

DDL commands are used to define or modify the structure of the database. These commands create, 
delete, or change tables and the database itself. They do not work with the actual data inside the 
tables but work with the structure. When you use DDL commands, the changes happen permanently in 
the database. 

DML

DML commands are used to insert, update, delete, or modify data inside the tables. These commands 
work directly with the data. DML commands do not change the table structure—they only affect the 
records.

DQL 

DQL is used to retrieve or fetch data from the database. It focuses only on getting data, not 
modifying it. DQL is mainly used in applications and reporting systems where data needs to be 
displayed to users.

DCL 

DCL commands are used to control access to the database. They provide security by allowing or 
restricting user permissions such as reading or modifying data.

TCL

TCL commands help manage transactions in the database. A transaction is a group of operations that 
must be executed completely or not at all. These commands ensure data safety and accuracy.

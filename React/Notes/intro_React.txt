1. Why we use React?
    
React is a powerful JavaScript library used to build fast and interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI parts that make code easier to manage. React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of a webpage that change, improving performance. With its declarative syntax, developers can describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the rendering automatically. Backed by Meta (Facebook) and a strong community, React offers great flexibility, reusability, and performance, making it one of the most popular choices for modern web development.

2. what is the difference between html using in webpage and react using webpage ?

Feature         HTML Webpage	           React Webpage
Structure      Static pages	            Dynamic components
Reloads	       Page reloads on navigation   No reload (SPA)
DOM	       Real DOM	                    Virtual DOM
Speed	       Slower updates	            Faster updates
Reusability    Limited	                    High (components)
User Experience	Basic	                    Smooth and app-like 

3. what is difference between react and angular ?

React	                                     Angular
Library (only for UI)	                     Full framework (complete structure)
Uses JavaScript	                             Uses TypeScript
Easier to learn	                             Little harder to learn
Needs extra libraries for routing or state.  Has everything built-in
Faster with Virtual DOM	                     Bigger but more powerful.

4. Why We Use Node.js in Web Development?

We use Node.js because it lets us build the backend of websites using JavaScript — the same language used for the frontend. It is fast, can handle many users at once, and is great for real-time apps like chat or live updates. Node also has many ready-made packages that make coding easier and quicker.

5. which is faster react or angular ? and why the reason 

React is generally faster than Angular.

why because:

React uses a Virtual DOM, , which updates only the parts of the page that change it make faster 
lightweight library, React is just a UI library(full framework).
Flexible Performance, optimize and load components only we needed.

6. what is babel compiler?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that helps your code run on all browsers.

It takes modern JavaScript (ES6 and above) or JSX (used in React) and converts it into older JavaScript that browsers can understand.
